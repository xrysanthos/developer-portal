      questions:
        - question: What is the Miami Open211 project?
          answer: The Miami Open211 project is prototyping an 'open platform' for the Miami 2-1-1 community resource referral program. 
        - question: Why is Miami Open211 deploying an API?
          answer: Miami's 2-1-1 hotline curates comprehensive directory information about the many health, human, and social services available to Miami-Dade residents in need. This project aims to demonstrate that API access to this data can expand the reach of 2-1-1's information and enhance its sustainability as a public service.
        - question: What can I build with the APIs?
          answer: The possibilities are endless!
